This is the backend that was originally hosted on alfredo.lol/karen. It contains the code for the Karen [API](https://github.com/AlfredoSequeida/KarenBackend/tree/main/api) as well as the [original docs](https://github.com/AlfredoSequeida/KarenBackend/blob/main/karen/templates/karen/docs-0.0.1.html). The alfredo.lol website was a Django website, so this includes the Karen app as well as the API while stripping out the rest of the site.
